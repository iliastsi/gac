** Fix in Lexer:
	Add error messages when include more than one char in \'
        We have to remove escape function from here and move it to codeGen state
                (we have some problems with error messages)

** Fix Parser:
	Express "this should be between spaces"
        Write better error messages (and enable parsing to continue)
        Activate cpp for Parser.y and rename it to Parser.y.pp
        Add the grammar rule to write `<string-literal>[<int>]>'

** Look in compiler/main/SysTools.lhs (ghc) for as, ld, llc, opt
