** Fix in Lexer:
        Add error messages when include more than one char in \'
        Fix number bound warnings (we may have errors given a very big number)

** Fix Parser:
        Express "this should be between spaces"
        Write better error messages (and enable parsing to continue)
        Add the grammar rule to write `<string-literal>[<int>]>'

** Look in compiler/main/SysTools.lhs (ghc) for as, ld, llc, opt
