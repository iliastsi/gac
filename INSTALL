This is the INSTALL instructions for a binary distribution of GAC. For
more details on what on earth this package is up to, please consult
the README.

This distribution can be installed in a location of your choosing.

To set the ball rolling, run the configure script.
eg. to set up the package for installing in directory <my-dir>, use

        ./configure --prefix=<my-dir>

The default installation directory is /usr/local

The configure script will figure out what platform you're
running on, and a couple of other interesting pieces of trivia.

Now run:

        make
        make install

Bug reports/suggestions for improvement to the installation
procedure/setup (as well as other GAC related troubles you're
experiencing, of course), gratefully received.  Bug reporting here:
