The Glorious Alan Compiler
============================

This is the source tree for GAC, a compiler for
the Alan programming language.

Getting the Source
==================

  The recommended way is to get the repos using mercurial

    $ hg clone http://foss.ntua.gr/hg/private/gac

  Of course right now this repo is password protected!!


Building & Installing
=====================

First you need GHC installed in order to build GAC, because the compiler
is itself written in Haskell. Hugs is supposed to work but it hasn't been
tested. You will alse need Alex [2] and Happy [3] Meta-Compilers.


Quick start:  the following gives you a default build:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

These steps give you the default build (an executable file
named gac, placed in dist/build/gac) which includes everything
optimised and built in various ways.
It can take a long time.  To customise the build, see the file
HACKING.

If you want to install the package type:

    $ make install

For more informations about installing the package see INSTALL
