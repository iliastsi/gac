Getting started with hacking on GHC
-----------------------------------

So you've decided to hack on GAC, congratulations!  We hope you have a
rewarding experience.  This file will point you in the direction of
information to help you get started right away.


The GHC Developer's Wiki
------------------------

  Quick Start for developers

     http://courses.softlab.ntua.gr/compilers/
   
     This page will get you up and running with compilers
     course and Alan language in no time:
  

  Coding conventions

     http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/WorkingConventions

     This wiki page explains the ground rules for code that is intended
     to go into the mainline compiler source.
  
  
Mailing lists

   Ask on iliastsi@hotmail.com if you have difficulties.


Layout of important files and directories
-----------------------------------------

This section summarises the overall file and directory structure
of GAC. Everything starts with the main GAC repository. The build
system calls that directory $(TOP).
All the paths below are relative to $(TOP).

  Files in $(TOP)
    Documentation files
        README, INSTALL, HACKING, LICENSE
    Cabal autoconfig machinery
        gac.cabal, Setup.hs
    Makefile
        The top-level Makefile. GAC requires GNU make.

  libraries/
    The libraries/ directory contains all the packages that a program
    written in Alan needs in order to build.

  src/, docs/
    These directories contain the main GAC compiler and documentation.
    The src/ directory contains the gac package, which is linked into
    an executable in the dist/ directory.

  testsuite/
    The testsuite/ directory contain apparatus for testing GAC.


Happy Hacking!  --The GAC Team
